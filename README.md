# freya.io

## Overview

This repository contains the content driving both the main [Freya site (freya.io)][freya.io], and the [Freya Documentation site (docs.freya.io)][docs.freya.io]. This repository therefore contains configuration, templating and content for both Jekyll (powering the main Freya site, hosted on GitHub pages) and Sphinx (powering the Freya Documentation site, hosted on [ReadTheDocs][rtd]).

This requires some fairly significant tweaking and prodding to work, and the Sphinx configuration in particular is a little non-standard, especially around theming.
