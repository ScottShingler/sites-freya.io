Machines
========

Freya Machines are a powerful tool, but the programming model can be new to many, especially given the prevalence of web frameworks (particularly MVC-style frameworks) where the logic is spread throughout the whole framework. Machines can therefore look daunting at first, but they actually represent a conceptually simpler and more straightforward approach.

The sub-sections give an explanation of Machine design and implementation in Freya, using an HTTP Machine as a convenient example where relevant.

The machine :doc:`machines/overview` is the ideal place to begin to understand the underlying model of machines.
