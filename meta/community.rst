Community
=========

The F# community is a friendly place and we hope for the same for Freya. We encourage everyone to come and talk in our `Gitter channel <https://gitter.im/xyncro/freya>`_ where all are welcome. It's a great place to ask questions!

For keeping up to date with news on Freya and the ecosystem around it, follow `Freya on Twitter <https://twitter.com/freyafs>`_ -- any news, changes, announcements, releases, etc. will be posted there, along with new blog posts, etc.

Most of all, we encourage you all to get involved, try Freya out, and :doc:`tell us what you think! <contact>`
