Policies
========

Freya does not have a large set of policies, but some aspects of the project do require explicit affirmation of expectations. Please read the following on conduct!

Conduct
-------

While Freya does not currently have an explicit code of conduct, any behaviour which prevents others from finding Freya and the Freya community a welcoming and friendly environment will not be tolerated. If you are unsure whether something is likely to be offensive or upsetting to others, that is usually a good indication that you probably shouldn't do it.

Were Freya to adopt a formal code of conduct, it would probably look rather like the `Rust Code of Conduct <https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/conduct.html>`_ -- please refer to that document for the kinds of behaviour expected of people taking part in the Freya community.

Open source software matters, but it matters less than people.
