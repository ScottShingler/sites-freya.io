Issues/Features
---------------

If you want to raise an issue relating to Freya, or suggest a new feature -- or an improvement to an existing one -- then the main `Freya repository on GitHub <https://github.com/xyncro/freya>`_ should be your first stop.

Issues, feature requests, etc. for Freya are tracked and managed using the GitHub Issues process. While Freya is split in to multiple repositories, issues raised against the main repository can be moved as needed, and it is often easier to work out where they should live later!
