    <h1>Purely Functional</h1>
    <p>Freya is a modern, purely functional stack for web programming in F#. Familiar functional programming techniques for state and concurrency are combined to give you a consistent and seamless approach to building web applications.</p>
    <div class="highlight">
      <pre>let ok =
    freya {
        do! Response.statusCode .= Some 200
        do! Response.reasonPhrase .= Some "OK" }</pre>
    </div>

  <section class="feature right">
    <h1>Typesafe Modelling</h1>
    <p>The powerful and comprehensive type systems available with Freya help you build safe and composable application components. Types for HTTP and surrounding standards give you the tools you need to make the most of the web.
    </p>
    <div class="highlight">
