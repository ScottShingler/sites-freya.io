title: 4.0 Alpha Builds Available

---

After a quieter time for Freya lately, we're pleased to release the packages for the first alpha releases of Freya 4.0. This will mark a major step forward, as 4.0 brings .NET Core support (feature changes are probably limited in this release, but are likely to follow).

Much thanks for the 4.0 .NET Core support goes to Marcus Griep ([@neoeinstein][neoeinstein]) for the huge amount of work he's put in to getting the build processes converted, etc. in the face of a fairly flux-y .NET Core ecosystem!
