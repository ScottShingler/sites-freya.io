Welcome to the new [freya.io]({{ site.urls.freya.core }})! It's taken some time to get here, but Freya now has a single place to go for updates and documentation, along with a new visual identity.

The blog (this is the first entry) will be the primary place for all announcements, etc., which will also be posted on [Twitter]({{ site.urls.freya.twitter }}) to give an easy way to stay up to date with all Freya information.

We also have a re-organised and expanded documentation collection, broken down in to topic based, reference guides, recipe style information, and tutorial content. Hopefully this will help get you up and running with Freya quicker, especially when paired with the new Getting Started guide -- which will be expanded to cover as many platforms and approaches as possible.

We hope you enjoy the new [freya.io]({{ site.urls.freya.core }}) -- please give us feedback on anything you think relevant!
