title: 3.0 RC Live!

---

As of today, the 3.0 RC (Release Candidate) builds were pushed to the public NuGet feed, and are now the recommended option for anyone adopting Freya, or upgrading an existing application. Hopefully these will go final in the next week or two, marking the start of the continuous release approach and semantic versioned releases that will follow the 3.0 milestone.

Thanks to everyone who's contributed and who's got Freya to where it is -- and now let's look forward to even better things!
