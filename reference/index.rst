Reference
=========

Reference documentation for Freya contains guides to specific libraries along with guides for using Freya as part of a larger system. These are technical guides and give an overview of general use, rather than a recipe-like approach. The reference documentation is designed to be referred to when you're using Freya.

The reference documentation is divided in to the main sets of libraries that make up the Freya stack. The library references cover the complete set of Freya functionality, and given both semantic and syntactic reference to the basic usage of the libraries.

When you're looking for more general information on how to work in Freya, and how to think about solving problems using Freya, you might want to look at some of the other documentation options, particularly:

* :doc:`/topics/index` -- for focused guides to areas of development with Freya.
* :doc:`/recipes/index` -- for Freya-based solutions to common problems.
